# Hamzau_rimedict
一份修減自《欽州白話》數據、聽在rime使得噶字詞庫碼表文件<br>
A dict file revised and reduced from the data of "Hamchow Cantonese" so that it can be used in rimes<br>
一份戥佢配套噶輸入方案<br>
A schema coming with the dict<br>
同埋包好欽拼噶小狼毫、同文包<br>
Also installation packages with this Hamping for Weasel and for Trime<br><br>
注意：建議在設置裏頭設同文鍵盤主題成tongwenfenggoi（同文風改）<br>
Attention: it is recommended to set the keyboard theme of Trime into "tongwenfenggoi"("Trime Style (Modified)") in Setting<br><br>
注意：想使tongwenfenggoi噶日文韓文鍵盤，你要裝有對應噶日文韓文思機碼，𠹲純假名鍵盤就冇使<br>
Attention: to use the keyboards for Japanese or Korean, you need to get corresponding Japanese or Korean schemata installed, but you don't need one for the keyboard of pure kana. <br><br>
